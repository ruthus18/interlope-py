# [0.2.0] VXC Global Illumination

    * Prepare codebase for GI implementation (GUI controls, clean modules and interfaces)

    * Scene voxelization (gfx_vx module) + renderer visualization
    * 3D textures (check GL extension, loading to GPU, mipmapping, GLSL manipulation)
    * Local Illumination model, set up gfxvx shaders interface, lighting configuration
    * Cone tracing algorithm...
    * Debugging and monitoring tools (RAM, VRAM usage, FPS graph)
    * GI configuration in GUI


# [0.1.0] 3D Viewer

    Ability to render single rotating model 

    * basic lighting
    * skybox

    Result: ability to walk through demo scene
